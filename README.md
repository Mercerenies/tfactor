# tfactor (Final Name TBD)

I haven't worked out a lot of the details, but here's the pitch:
Statically-typed concatenative language. Right now, there's not a
whole lot to show. I have a working factorial function, but that's
about it.

Build with `stack build`. Run with `stack run <filename>`. The type
errors aren't great right now, but if your program is typesafe then
it'll run your `main` function and print out the stack after
execution. `testfile.txt` and `testfile1.txt` are two sample programs.
